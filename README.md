# Pytest intro code

## About

Some pytest examples to serve as a reference from Reuven M. Lerner's two tutorials:

* https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/testing-your-code-pythons-pytest

* https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/testing-your-code-pythons-pytest-part-ii

with small additions to account probably for python version differences
